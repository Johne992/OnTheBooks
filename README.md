On the Books: Jim Crow and Algorithms of Resistance is a [collections as data project](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/) of the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries](https://library.unc.edu/) to make North Carolina legal history accessible to researchers by creating a corpus that contains over one hundred years of North Carolina public, private, and local session laws and resolutions from the end of Civil War through the civil rights movement (1865-1968). This 16-month project started in January 2019.
