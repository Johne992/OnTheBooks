# On the Books

On the Books is [a collections as data project](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/) to make North Carolina legal history
accessible to researchers by creating a corpus that contains over one hundred years of
North Carolina public, private, and local session laws and resolutions from the end of
civil war through the civil rights movement (1865-1968).
