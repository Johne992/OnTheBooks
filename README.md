On the Books: Jim Crow and Algorithms of Resistance is a [collections as data project](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/) of the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries](https://library.unc.edu/) to make North Carolina legal history accessible to researchers by creating a corpus that contains over one hundred years of North Carolina session laws from Reconstruction through the Civil Rights Movement (1866-1967). The project also used machine learning to identify Jim Crow laws during this period.
