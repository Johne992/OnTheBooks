ORGANIZATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES.   "
CHAPTER 54.,Src. 24.,"Src. 24. Insurance companies may be formed as provided in  section twenty-five for any one of the following purposes, to-wit:  _ First. To insure against loss or damage to property by fire,  lightning or tornado, use and occupancy, and for non-occupancy,  upon the stock or mutual plan.   Second. To insure upon the stock or mutual plan, vessels,  freights, goods, money, effects, and money lent on bottomry or  respondentia against the perils of the sea and other perils usually  insured against by marine insurance, including risks of inland  navigation and transportation.   Third. To guarantee the fidelity of persons in positions of trust,  private or public, and to act as surety on official bonds and for  the performance of other obligations.   Fourth. To insure against loss or damage to property of the  assured, or loss or dainage to the life, person or property of an-  other for which the assured is liable, caused by the explosion of  steam boilers.     Fifth. To insure any person against bodily injury or death by  accident, or any person, firm or corporation against loss or dam-  age on account of the bodily injury or death by accident of any  person, for which loss or damage said person, firm or corporation  is responsible.   Sixth. To insure against the breakage of plate glass, local or  in transit.   Seventh. To insure against loss or damage by water to any  goods or premises arising or leakage of sprinklers and water  pipes.   Kighth. To insure against loss or damage to property arising  from accidents to elevators, bicycles and vehicles. except rolling  stock of railways.   Ninth. To carry on the business commonly known as credit in-  surance or guaranty, either by agreeing to purchase uncollectible  debts or otherwise to insure against loss or damage from the fail-  ure of persons indebted to the assured to meet their liabilities.   All insurance companies authorized to transact fire insurance  business in this state may. in addition to the business which they  are now authorized by law to do, insure sprinklers, pumps and  other apparatus erected or put in position for the purpose of ex-  tinguishing fires, against damage, loss or injury resulting from  accidental causes other than fire; and also insure any property  which such companies are authorized to insure against loss or  damage by fire, against damage, loss or injury by water or other-  wise, resulting from the accidental breaking off or injury to such  sprinklers. pumps or other apparatus, arising from causes other  than fire. Contracts of insurance of this kind, provided for in  this paragraph, shall not be incorporated in any contract of in-  surance against loss o1 damage by fire, but shall be contained in  separate and distinct policies, the conditions of which shall be  prescribed by the insurance commissioner for the state.   Sc. 25. The procedure for organizing such a corporation shall,  be as follows: The proposed corporators, a majority of whom  must be residents of the state and not less than ten. shall sub-  scribe articles of association setting forth their intention to form  a corporation; its proposed name. which must not so closely re-  semble the name of an existing corporation doing business under  the laws of this state as to be likeky to mislead the public, and  must be approved by the insurance commissioner; the class of in-  surance it proposes to transact and on what business plan or prin-  ciple; the place within the state of its location, and, if on the  stock plan, the amount of its capital stock. The words insur-  ance company must be a part of the title of any such corpora-  tion, and also the word mutual,* if it is organized upon the mu-  tual principle. The first meeting for the purpose of organization     shall be called by a notice signed by one or more of the subscrib-  ers to the articles of the association, stating the time, place and  purpose of the meeting, a copy whereof shall, seven days at least  before the appointed time, be given to each subscriber, or left at  his usual place of business or residence, or duly mailed to his  post office address. And whoever gives such notice shall make  affidavit thereof, which shall include a copy of the notice and be  entered upon the records of the corporation. At such first meet-  ing, including any adjournment thereof, an organization shall be  effected by the choice of a temporary clerk, who shall be sworn,  by the adoption of by-laws and by the election of directors and  such other officers as the by-laws may require; but at such first  meeting no person shall be elected director who has not signed  the articles of association. The temporary clerk shall record the  proceedings until and including the choice and qualification of  the secretary. The directors so chosen shall elect a president,  secretary and other officers which under the by-laws they are so  authorized to choose. The president, secretary and a majority  of the directors, shall forthwith make, sign and swear to a certifi-  eate setting forth a copy of the articles of association, with the  names of the subscribers thereto, the date of the first meetings  and of any adjournments thereof, and shall submit such certifi-  eate and the records of the corporation to the insurance comunis.  sioner, who shall examine the same, and who may require such  other evidence as he may deem necessary. The insurance com-  missioner, if it appears that the requirements of the law as herein  have been complied with, shall certify the fact and his approval  of the certificate, by endorsement thereon. Such certificate shall  thereupon be filed by said officers in the office of the secretary of  state, who, upon payment of a fee of twenty-five dollars, shall  cause the certificate with the endorsement thereon to be recorded,  and shall issue a certificate in the following form:    State of North Carolina.    Be it know that whereas (here the names of the subscribers to  the articles of association shall be inserted) have associated them:  selves with the intention of forming a corporation under the  name of (here the name of the corporation shail be inserted), for  the purpose (here the purpose declared in the articles of associa-  tion shall be inserted), with a capital (or with a permanent fund)  of (here the amount of capital or permanent fund fixed in the  articles of association shall be inserted) and have complied with  the provisions of the statute of this state in such case made and  provided, as appears from the certificate of the president, secretary  and directors of said corporation, duly approved by the insur-  ance commissioner and recorded in this office: Now, therefore, I,     (here the name of the secretary shail be inserted), secretary of the  state of North Carolina, do hereby certify that said (here the  names of the subscribers to the articles of association shall be in-  serted), their associates and successors, are legally organized and  established as, and are hereby made an existing corporation un-  der the name of (here the name of the corporation de inserted),  with the powers, rights and privileges and subject to the duties,  liabilities and restrictions which by law appertain thereto.   Witness my official signature hereunto subscribed, and the seal  of the state of North Carolina hereunto affixed, this the ____ day,  Ofte , in the year -__- (in these blanks the day, month and  year of execution of this certificate shall be inserted; and in the  case of purely mutual companies, so much as relates to capital  stock shall be omitted).    The secretary shall sign the same and cause the seal of the state  to be thereto affixed, and such certificate shall have the force and.  effect of a special charter and be conclusive evidence of the or-:  ganization and establishment of such corporation. He shall-also:  cause a record of such certificate to be made, and a certified copy  of such record may be given in evidence with the like effect as  the original certificate.    AMOUNT OF CAPITAL.   "
CHAPTER 54.,SEc. 26.,"SEc. 26. No corporation so formed shall transact any other  business than that specified in its charter and articles of associa-  tion. Companies to insure plate glass may organize with a capi-  tal of not less than ten thousand dollars. Companies so formed  insuring marine risks or inland risks upon the stock plan shall  have a capital of not less than twenty-five thousand dollars.  Companies for the purpose of transacting fire insurance on the  stock plan, of fidelity insurance, of accident insurance, of steam  boiler insurance, or for the transaction of the business authorized  under the seventh, eighth and ninth paragraph of section twenty-  four of this act, shall have a capital of not less than fifty thou-  sand dollars. Companies may be so formed to insure mechanics  tools and apparatus against loss by fire for an amount not exceed-  ing two hundred and fifty dollars in a single risk, with a capital  of not less than ten thousand doliars, divided into shares of the  par value of ten dollars each.    PAYMENT AND INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL.   "
CHAPTER 54.,Src. 27.,"Src. 27. The capital stock shall be paid in cash within twelve  months from datéof charter or certificate of organization, and no  certificate of full shares and no policies shail be issued until the  whole capital is paid in. A majority of the directors shall certify     on oath that the money has been paid by the stockholders for  their respective shares and the same is held as the capital of the  company invested or to be invested as required by this section.  Such capital shall be invested only as follows:   First. In first mortgages of real estate in this state.   Second. In bonds of the United States or of any of the states  whose bonds do not sell for less than par.   Third. In the bonds or notes of any city, county or town of this  state whose net indebtedness does not exceed five per cent of  the last preceding valuation of the property therein for purposes  of taxation. The term net indebtedness excludes any debt  created to provide a supply of water for general domestic use,  and allows credit for the sinking fund of a county, city, town or  district, available for the payment of its indebtedness.    IMPAIRMENT, INCREASE AND REDUCTION OF CAPITAL.   "
CHAPTER 54.,SEc. 28.,"SEc. 28. When the net assets of a company do not amount to  more than three-fourths of its original capital, it may make good  its capilal to the original amount by assessment of its stock.  Shares on which such an assessment is not paid within sixty days  after demand shall be forfeitable, and may be cancelled by vote  of the directors, and new shares issued to make up the deficiency.  If such company shall not within three months after notice from  the insurance commissioner to that effect make good its capital  as aforesaid, or reduce the same as allowed by section -__-, its  authority to transact new business of insurance shall be revoked  by said commissioner.  "
CHAPTER 54.,SEc. 29.,"SEc. 29. Any such company may issue pro rata to its stockhold-  ers certificates of any portion of its actual net surplus it may  deem fit to divide, which shall be deemed to be an increase of its  capital to the amount of such certificates. And such company  may, at a meeting called for the purpose, vote to increase the  amount and number of shares of its capital stock, and to issue  certificates thereof when paid in full. In whichever mode the  increase is made, the company shall within thirty days after the  issue of such certificates, submit to the insurance commissioner a  certificate setting forth the amount of the increase and the facts  of the transaction, signed and sworn to by its president and sec-  retary and a majority of its directors. If the insurance commis-  sioner finds that the facts conform to the law he shall endorse his  approval thereof; and upon filing such certificate so endorsed  with the secretary of state, and the payment of a fee of five dol-  lars for filing the same, the company may transact business upon  the capital as increased, and the insurance commissioner shall  issue his certificate to that effect.  "
CHAPTER 54.,SEc. 30.,"SEc. 30. When the capital stock of a company is impaired, such     company may, upon a vote of the majority of the stock repre-  sented at a meeting legally called for that purpose. reduce its eap-  ital stock and the number of shares thereof to an amount not less  than the mini:num sum required by law. But no part of its assets  and, property shall be distributed to its stockholders. Within  ten days after such meeting the company shall submit to the in-  surance commissioner a certificate setting forth the proceedings  thereof and the amount of such reduction and the assets and  liabilities of the company, signed and sworn to by its president,  secretary and a majority of its directors. The insurance com-  missioner shall examine the facts in the case, and if the same  conform to law and in his judgment the proposed reduction  may be made without prejudice to the public, he shall endorse  his approval upon the certificate. Upon filing the certificate so  endorsed with the secretary of state and paying a fee of five dol-  lars for the filing thereof, the company may transact business  upon the basis of such reduced capital as though the same were  its original capital, and its charter shall be deemed to be amended  to conform thereto, and the insurance commissioner shall issue  his certificate to that effect. Such company may by a majority  vote of. its directors, after such reduction, require the return of  the original certificates of stock heid by each stockholder in ex-  change for new certificates it may issue in lieu thereof for such  number of shares as each stockholder is entitled toin the propor-  tion that the reduced capital bears to the original capital.  "
CHAPTER 54.,Ssc. 31.,"Ssc. 31. No stock company shall make a dividend, either in  eash or stock certificate, except from its actual net surplus com-  puted as required by law in its annual statements, nor shall any  company which has ceased to do new business of insurance divide  any portion of its assets, except surplus to its stockholders, until  it shall have performed or cancelled its policy obligation.    MUTUAL FIRE CoMPANIES.   "
CHAPTER 54.,SEc. 32.,"SEc. 32. No policy shall be issued by a purely mutual fire in-  surance company hereafter organized, nor by a mutual fire insur-  ance company with a guaranty capital of kess than fifty thousand  dollars, until not less than two hundred thousand dollars of in-  surance, in not less than two hundred separate risks upon prop-  erty located in North Carolina. has been subscribed for and en-  tered on its books. But no policy shall be issued under this sec-  tion until the president and the secretary of the company shall  have certified under oath that each and every subscription for  insurance in the list presented to the insurance commissioner for  approval is genuine and made with an agreement with each and  every subscriber for insurance that he will take the policies sub-  scribed for by him within thirty days of the granting of a license     to the company by the insurance commissioner to issue policies.  For taking a false oath in respect to such certificates such officers  shall be deemed guilty of the crime of perjury, and be subject to  the legal penalties therefor. Ne officer or other person whose  duty it is to determine the character of the risks, and upon whose  decision the application shall be accepted or rejected by a mutual  fire insurance company, shall receive as any part of his compen.  sation a commission upon the premiums, but his compensation  shall be a fixed salary and such share in the net profits as the  directors may determine. Nor shall such officer or person afore  said be an employee of any officer or agent of the company.    a MEMBERS AND ELECTION.   "

"
CHAPTER 54.,SEc. 34.,"SEc. 34. A mutual fire insurance company may be formed as  proviced in section thiity-two, or a mutual fire insurance com-  pany now existing may establish a guaranty capital of not less  than twenty-five thousand dollars nor more than two hundred  thousand dollars, divided into shares of one hundred dollars each,  which shall be invested in the same manner as is provided for the  investment of the capital stock of certain insurance companies  by section twenty-seven of this act. The stockholders of the  guaranty capital of a company shall be entitled to a semi-annual  dividend of not more than three and one-half per centum on  their respective shares of the net profits or unused premmums left  after all expenses, losses and liabilities then incurred, together  with the reserve for reinsurance, as provided for, shall be suffi-  cient to pay the same. The guaranty capital shall be applied to  the payment of losses only when the company has exhausted its  cash in hand, and the invested assets, exclusive of uncollected  premiums, and when thus impaired, the directors may make good  the whole or any part of it by assessments upon the contingent  funds of the company at the date of such impairment. Share-  holders and members of such companies shall be subject to the  same provisions of law in respect to their right to vote as apply  respectively to shareholders in stock companies and policy: hold-  ers in purely mutual companies; and such guaranty capital shall  be retired when the permanent fund of the company equals two  per centum of the amount insured upon all policies in force; and  said guaranty capital may be reduced or retired by vote of the  policy-holders of the company and the assent of the insurance  commissioner: Provided, the net assets of the company above  its reinsurance reserve and all other claims and obligations, ex-  clusive of guaranty capital, for two years immediately preceding  and including the date of its last annual statement, shall not be  less than twenty-five per centum of the guaranty capital.

"
CHAPTER 54.,Src. 35.,"Src. 35. The directors of any mutual fire insurance company  may from time to time by vote fix and determine the amount to  be paid as a dividend upon policies expiring during each year.  Each policy-holder shall be liable to pay his proportional share  of any assessments which may be laid by the company in accord-  ance with law and his contract on account of losses incurred while  he was a member: Provided, he is notified of such assessments  within one year after the expiration of his policy. Any mutual  fire insurance company doing business with a fixed annual pre-  mium may in its by-laws and policies fix the contingent liability  of its members for the payment of losses and expenses not pro.  vided for by its cash funds: Provided, that such contingent  liability of a member shall not be less than a sum equal to five  times the cash premiums written in his policy and in addition  thereto. The total amount of the liability of the policy-holder  shall be plainly and legibly stated upon the back of each policy.  Whenever any reduction is made in the contingent liability of  members, such reduction shall apply proportionally to all poli-    cies in force. peat SEpuuRC    ASSESSMENTS.    Sc. 36. Whenever a mutual fire insurance company is not pos-  sessed of cash funds above its reinsurance reserve sufficient for  the payment of insured losses and expenses, it shall make an  assessment for the amount needed to pay such losses and expenses  upon its members liable to assessment therefor in proportion to  heir several liability. The company shall cause to be recorded  in a book kept. for that purpose the order for such assessment,  together with a statement which shall set forth the condition of  the company at the date of the order, the-amount of its cash  assets and of its deposit, notes or other contingent funds liable to  the assessment, the amount the assessment calls for and the par-  ticular losses or liabilities it is made to provide for. Such record  shall be made and signed by the directors who voted for the or-  der before any part of the assessment is collected, and any person  liable to the assessment may inspect and take a copy of the same.  "
CHAPTER 54.,Src. 37.,"Src. 37. When by reason of depreciation or loss of its funds or  otherwise the cash assets of such a company, after providing for  its other debits, are less than the required premium reserve upon  its policies, it shall make good the deficiency by assessment in the  mode provided in the preceding section; and if the directors are  of the opinion that the company is liable to become insolvent  they may, instead of such assessment, make two assessments; the  first determining what each policy-holder must equitably pay or    11     receive in case of withdrawal from the company and having his  policy cancelled; the second, what further sum each must pay in  order to reinsure the unexpired term of his policy at the same  rate as the whole was insured at first. Each policy-holder shall  pay or receive according to the first assessment, and his policy  shall be cancelled unless he pays the sum further determined by  the second assessment, in which ease his policy shall continue in  force; but in neither case shall a policy-holder receive or have  credited to him more than he would have received on having his  policy cancelled by vote of the directors under the by-laws.

Such companies shall not be subject to the provis-  ions of this chapter except as regards the manner of their forma-  tion and as follows, to-wit: Any such corporation, before it shall  issue any policy or make any contract or guarantee of insurance,  shall file with the insurance commissioner a certified copy of the  record or the certificate of its organization in the office of the see:  retary of state, and shall obtain from the insurance commissioner  his certificate that it has complied with the laws applicable to it  and is authorized to do business. Every such corporation shall,  on or before the thirteenth day of January of each year, file in  the office of the insurance commissioner a statement such as he  may require of its condition and of its affairs for the year ending  on the preceding thirty-first day of December, signed and sworn  to by its president or secretary or treasurer and one of its direct-  ors, and for neglect to file such annual statements or for making  a willfully false statement shall be liable to the same penalties as  are imposed upon insurance companies. The insurance commis-  sioner shall have the same power and authority to visit and ex-  amine such corporations as he has in the case of domestic insur-  ance companies, and the duties and liabilities of such corpora-  tions and their agents in reference to such examinations shall be  the same as those of domestic insurance companies.

Every insur-  ance company transacting business in this state shall, upon recoiv-  ing notice of loss by fire of property in North Carolina, on which  it is liable under a policy of insurance, forthwith notify the in-  surance commissioner thereof, and no insurance upon any such  property shall be paid by any company until one week after such  notification.  "
CHAPTER 54.,SEc. 41.,"SEc. 41. Where by an agreement with the assured or by the  terms of a fire insurance policy taken out by a mortgagor, the  whole or any part of the loss thereon is payable to a mortgagee  or mortgagees of the property for their benefit, the company  shall, upon satisfactory proof of the rights and title of the par-  ties, in accordance with such terms or agreement, pay all mort  gagees protected by such policy in the order of their priority of  claim, as their claims shall appear, not beyond the amount for  which the company is liable, and such payments shall be to the  extent thereof, payment and satisfaction of the liabilities of the  company under such policy.  "
CHAPTER 54.,SEc. 42.,"SEc. 42. In all insurance against loss by fire the conditions of  insurance shall be stated in full, and the rules and by-laws of the  company shall not be considered as a warranty or a part of the    contract, except so far as they are incorporated in full into the  policy.

It must be in writing and signed by the maker or drawer.   2. Must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a  sum certain in money.   3. Must be payable on demand or at a fixed or determinate  future time.   4. Must be payable to the order of a specified person or to  bearer; and   5. Where the instrument is addressed to a drawee, he must be  named, or otherwise indicated therein with reasonable certainty.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEC. 2.,"SEC. 2. The sum payable is a sum certain with [within] the  meaning of this act, although it is to be paid: :   1. With interest; or   2. By stated installments; or   3. By stated installments with a provision that upon default in  payment of any installment, the whole shall become due; or   4. With exchange, whether at.a fixed rate or at the current  rate; or   5. With costs of collection, or an attorneys fee, in case pay-  ment shall not be made at maturity.   »"
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 3.,"SEc. 3. An unqualified order or promise to pay is uncondi-  tional within the meaning of this act, though coupled with:   1. An indication of a particular fund out of which reimburse-  ment is to be made, ora particular account to be debited with  the amount; or   2. A statement of the transaction which gives rise to the instru-  ment.   But an order or promise to pay out of a particular fund is not  unconditional.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 4.,"Sec. 4. An instrument is payable at a determinable future  tive, within the meaning of this act, which is expressed to he  payable:   1. Ata fixed period after date or sight; or       An instrument payable upon a contingency is not negotiable,  and the happening of the event does not cure the defect.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 5.,Src. 5. An instrament which contains an order or promise to  do any act in addition to the payment of nioney isnot negctiable.  But the negotiable character of an instrument otherwise nego-  tiable is not affected by a provision which:   1. Authorizes the sale of collaterai securities in case the instru-  ment be not paid at maturity; or   2. Authorizes a confession of judgment if the instrument be  not paid at maturity; or   3. Waives the benefit of any law intended for the advantage  er protection of obligator; or   4. Gives the holder an election to require something to be done  in lieu of payment of money.   But nothing in this section shall validate any provision or stip-  ulation otherwise illegal.  
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 6.,"SEc. 6. The validity and negotiable character of an instrument  are not affected by the fact that:   1. It is not dated: or   2. Does not specify the value given, or that any value has been  given therefor;.or   8. Does not specify the place where it is dicen or the loince  where it is payable; or .   4. Bears a seal; or   5. Designates a particular kind of current money in which pay-  ment is to be made.   But nothing in this section shall alter or repeal any statute  requiring in certain cases the nature of the consideration to be  stated in the instrument.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 7.,"Src. 7. An instrument is payable on demand:   1. When it is expressed to be payable on demand, or at sight  or on presentation; or   2. In which no time for payment is expressed.   Where an instrument is issued, accepted or indorsed when over-  due, it is, as regards the person so issuing, accepting or indorsing  it, payable on demand.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 8.,"SEc. 8. The instrument is payable to order where it is drawn  payable to the order of a specified person, or to him or his order.  It may be drawn payable to the order of:   . A payee who is not maker, drawer or drawee; or   The drawer or maker; or   The drawee; or   Two or more payees jointly; or   . One or some of several payees, or   . The holder of an office for the time being.    @ ow we     Where the instrument is payable to order, the payee must be  named or otherwise indicated therein with reasonable certainby,  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEC. 9.,"SEC. 9. The instrument is payable to bearer:   1. When it is expressed to be so payable; or   2. When it is payable to a person named therein or bearer; or   3. When it is payable to the order of a fictitious or non-exist-  ing person, and such fact was known to the person making it so  payable: or   4. When the name of the payee does not purport to be the  name of any person; or   5. When the only or last indorsement is an indorsement in  blank.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 10.,"Src. 10. The negotiable instrument need not follow the lan-  guage of this act, but any terms are sufficient which clearly in-  dicate an intention to conform to the requirements hereof.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 11.,"SEc. 11. Where the instrument or an acceptance or any indorse-  ment thereon is dated, such date is deemed prima facie to be the  true date of the making, drawing, acceptance or indorsement, as  the case may be. .  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 12.,"Sec. 12. The instrument is not invalid for the reason only thee  it is dnte-dated or post-dated, provided that this is not done for  an illegal or fraudulent purpose. The person to whom an instru-  ment so dated is delivered, acquires the title thereto as of the  date of delivery.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SkEc. 18.,"SkEc. 18. When .an instr eer expressed to be eee at a  fixed period after date is issued undated, or where the acceptance  of an instrument payable at a fixed period after sight is un-  dated, any holder may insert therein the true date of issue. or  acceptance, and the instrument shall be payabie accordingly.  The insertion of a wrong date does not avoid the jnstrument in  the hands of a subsequent holder in due course; but as to him  the date so inserted is to be regarded as the true date.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Suc. 14.,"Suc. 14. Where the instrument is wanting in any material par-  ticular, the person in possession thereof has a prima facie au-  thority to complete it by filling up the blanks therein. Anda  signature on a blank paper delivered by the person making the  signature in order that the paper may be converted into a nego-  tiable instrument operates as a prima facie authority to fill it up  as such for any amount. In order, however, that any such in-  strument when campleted may be enforced against any person  who became a party thereto prior to its completion it must be  filled up strictly in accordance with the authority given and  within a reasonable time. But if any such instrument after com-  pletion is negotiable to a holder in due course, it is valid and  effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as     if it had been filled up strictly in accordance with the authority  given and within a reasonable time.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 15.,Src. 15. Where an incomplete instrument has not been deliv-  ered it will not if completed and negotiated without authority  be a valid contract in the hands of any holder as against any  person whose signature was placed thereon before delivery.  
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 16,"Src. 16 Every contract on a negotiable instrument is incon-  plete and revocable until delivery of the instrument for the pur-  pose of giving effect thereto. As between immediate parties and  as regards a remote party other than a holder in due course, the  delivery in order to be effectual must be made either by or under  the authority of the party making, drawing or indorsing, as the  ease may be; and in such case the delivery may be shown to  have been conditional or for a special purpose ouly, and not for  the purpose of transferring the property in the instrument. But  where the instrument is in the hands of a holder in due course a  valid delivery thereof by all parties prior to him so as to make  them liable to him isconclusively presumed. And where the in-  strument is no longer in possession of a party whose signature  appears thereon, a valid and intentional delivery by him is pre-  sumed until the contrary is proved.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 17.,"Sec. 17. Where the language of the instrument is ambiguous or  there are omissions therein the following rules of construction  apply:   1. Where the sum payable is expressed in words and also in  figures and there is a discrepancy between the two, the sum  denoted by the words is the sum payable; but if the words are  ambiguous or uncertain, references may be had to the figures to  fix the amount.   2. Where the instrument provides for the payment of interest  without specifying the date from which interest is to run, the  interest runs from the date of the instrument, and if the instru-  ment is undated from the issue thereof.   3. Where the instrument is not dated it will be considered to  be dated as of the time it was issued.   4, Where there is conflict between the written and printed pro-  visions of the instrument the written provisions prevail.   5. Where the instrument is so ambiguous that there is doubt  whether it is a bill or a note the holder may treat it as either at  his election.   6. Where a signature is so placed upon the instrument that it  is not clear in what capacity the person making the same intended  to sign, he is to be deemed an indorser.   7. Where an instrument containing the words, I promise to  pay is signed by two or more persons, they are deemed to be  jointly and severally liable thereon.    59     Stc..18. No person is liable on the instrument whose signature  does not appear thereon, except as herein otherwise expressly  provided: But one who signs in a trade or assumed name will be  liable to the same extent as if he had signed in his own name.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 19.,"Sec. 19. The signature of any party made [may] be made by a  duly authorized agent. No particular form of appointment is  necessary for this purpose, and the authority of the agent may  be established as in other cases of agency.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 20.,"SEc. 20. Where the instrument contains or a person adds to his  signature words indieating that he sign- for or on behalf of the  principal or in a representative capacity, he is not liable on the  instrument if he was duly authorized; but the mere addition of  words describing him as an agent or as filling a representative  character, without disclosing his principal, does not exempt him  from personal liability.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 21.,"SEc. 21. A signature by procuration operates as notice that  the agent has but a limited authority to sign, and the principal  is bound only in case the agent so signing acted within the actual  limits of his authority.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEO. 22.,"SEO. 22. The indorsement or assigninent of the instrument by  a corporation or by an infant passes the property therein, not-  withstanding that from want of capacity the corporation or in-  fant may incur no liability thereon.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 23.,"SEc. 23. When a signature is forged or made without the au-  thority of the person whose signature it purports to be, it is  wholly inoperative and no right to retain the instrument or to  give a discharge therefor or to enforce payment thereof against  any party thereto can be acquired through or under such signa-  ture, unless the party against whom it is sought to enforce such  right is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.    ARTICLE II.   "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 24.,"Src. 24. Every negotiable instrument is deemed prima facie {e  have been issued for a valuable consideration, and every person  whose signature appears thereon to have become a party therete  for value.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 25.,Src. 25. Value is any consideration sufficient to support a sim  ple contract. An antecedent or pre-existing debt constitutes vaiue  and is deemed such whether the instrument is payable on demand  or at a future time.  
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 26.,Sec. 26. Where value has at any time been given for the instru  ment the holder is deemed a holder for value in respect to all par-  ties who became such prior to that time.  
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 27.,Src. 27. Where the holder has a lien on the instrument arising  either from contract or by implication of jaw he is deemed a  holder for value to the extent of his lien.     ~
CHAPTER 738.,SEC. 28.,"SEC. 28. Absence or failure of consideration is matter of defense  as against any person not a holder in due course, and partial  failure of consideration is a defense pro tanto, whether the failare  is an ascertained and liquidated amount or otherwise.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 29.,"SEc. 29. An accommodation party is one who has signed the  instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor. or indorser without, re-  eeiving value therefor, and for the purpose of lending his name  to some other person."
CHAPTER 738.,Such a,"Such a person is liable on the instrument  to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder at the time of  taking the instrument knew him to be only an accommodation    party.  ARTICLE I1I.NEGOTIATION.   "
CHAPTER 738.,SkEc. 30.,"SkEc. 30. An instrument is negotiated when it is transferred  from one person to another in such manner as to constitute the  transferee the holder thereof, if payable to bearer it is negotiated  by delivery; if payable to order it is negotiated by the indorse-  ment of the holder, completed by delivery.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 31.,"Sec. 31. The indorsemert must be written on the instrument  itself or upon a paper attached thereto. The signature of the  indorser, without additional words, is a sufficient indorsement.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Skc. 32.,"Skc. 32. An indorsement must be an indorsement of the entire  instrument. An indorsement which purports to transfer to the  imdorsee a part only of the amount payable or which purports  to transfer the instrument to two or more indorsees severally,  does not operate as a negotiation of the instrument. But where  the instrument has been paid in part it may be indorsed as to  the residue.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 33.,"Sec. 33. Anindorsement may be either in blank or special, and  it. may also be either restrictive or qualified or conditional.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Stc. 34.,"Stc. 34. A special indorsement specifies the person to whom or  to whose order the instrument is to be payable; and the indorse-  ment of such indorsee is necessary to the further negotiation of  the instrument. An indorsement in blank specifies no indorsee,  and an instrument so indorsed is payable to bearer and may be  negotiated by delivery.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 35.,"SEc. 35. The holder may convert a blank indorsement into a  special indorsement by writing over the signature of the indorser  in blank any contract consistent with the character of the in-  dorsement.   [Sec.] 36. An indorsement is restrictive, which either:   1. Prohibits the further negotiation of the instrument; or   2. Constitutes the indorsee the agent of the indorser; or   3. Vests the title in the indorsee in trust for or to the use of  some other person. But the mere absence of words implying  power to negotiate does not make an indorsement restrictive.    "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 87.,"Src. 87. A restrictive indorsement confers upon the indorsee  the right:   1. To receive payment of the instrument.   2. To bring any action thereon that the indorser could bring.   3. To transfer his rights as such indorsee, ee the form of ~  the indorsement authorizes him to do so   _ But all subsequent indorsees acquire only the title of the first  indorsee under the restrictive indorsement.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 38.,"Sec. 38. A qualified indorsement constitutes the indorser a  mere assignor of the title to the instrument. It may be made by  adding to the indorsers signature the words, without recourse  or any words of similar import. Such an indorsement does not  impair the negotiable character of the instrument.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 39.,"Src. 39. Where an indorsement is conditional, a party required ,  to pay the instrument may disregard the condition and make  payment to the indorsee or his transferee, whether the condition  has been fulfilled or not. But any person to whom an instrument  so indorsed is negotiated will hold the same or the proceeds  thereof subject to the rights of the person indorsing condi-  tionally.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 40.,"Src. 40. Where an instrument payable to bearer is indorsed  specially, it may nevertheless be further negotiated by delivery;  but the person indorsing specially is liable as indorser to only  such holders as make title through his indorsement.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Suc. 41.,"Suc. 41. Where an instrument is payable to the order of two or  more payees or indorsees who are not partners, all must indorse  unless the one indorsing has authority to indorse for the others.   "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 42.,"Src. 42. Where an instrument is drawn or indorsed toa person ~  as cashier or other fiscal officer of a bank or corporation it is  deemed prima facie to be payable to the bank or corporation of  which he is such officer, and may be negotiated by either the in-  dorsement of the bank or corporation or the indorsement of the  officer.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 43.,"Sec. 43. Where the names of a payee or indorsee is wrongly  designated or misspelled he may endorse the instrument as there  described, adding if he think fit his proper signature.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 44.,Sec. 44. Where any person is under obligation to indorse in  a representative capacity he may indorse in such terms as to  negative personal liability.  
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 45.,"Src. 45. Extept where an indorsement bears date after the  maturity of the instrument, every negotiation is deemed prima  facie to have been effected before the instrument was over due.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Suc. 46.,"Suc. 46. Except where the contrary appears, every indorsement  is presumed prima facie to have been made at the place where ©  the instrument is dated.    "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 47.,Sec. 47. An instrument negotiable in its origin continues to be  negotiable until it has been restrictively indorsed or discharged  by payment or otherwise.  
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 48.,Src. 48. The holder may [at] any time strike out any indorse-  ment which is not necessary to his title. The indorser whose in-  dorsement is struck out and all indorsers subsequent to him are  thereby relieved from liability on the instrument.  
CHAPTER 738.,Suc. 49.,"Suc. 49. Where the holder of an instrument payable to his or-  der transfers it for value without indorsing it, the transfer vests  in the transferee such title as the transferer had therein, and the  transferee acquires in addition the right to have the indorse-  ment of the transferer. But for the purpose of. determining  whether the transferee is a holder in due course, the negotiation  takes effect as of the time when the indorsement is actually  made.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sxc. 50.,"Sxc. 50. Where an instrument is negotiated back to a prior  party, such party may, subject to the provisions of this act, re-  issue and further negotiate the same. But he is not entitled to  enforce payment thereof against [any] intervening party to whom  he was personally liable.    ARTICLE IV.RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER.   "
CHAPTER 738.,Sxc. 51.,Sxc. 51. The holder of anegotiable instrument may sue thereon  in his own name and payment tu him in due course discharges  the instrument.  
CHAPTER 738.,Sxc. 52.,"Sxc. 52. A bolder in due course is a holder who has taken the  instrument under the following conditions:   1. That the instrument is complete and regular upon its face.   2. That he became the holder of it before it was overdue and  without notice that it had been previously dishonored if such  was the fact.   3. That he took it for good faith and value.   4. That at the time it was negotiated to him the had no notice  ef any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the  person negotiating it.   Sc. 53. Where an instrument payable on demand is negotiated  an unreasonable length of time after its issue, the holder is not  deemed a holder in due course.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 54.,"Sec. 54. Where the transferee received notice of any infirmity  in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating  the same before he has paid the full amount agreed to be paid  therefor, he will be deemed a holder in due course only to the  extent of the amount theretofore paid by him.   Sc. 55. The title of a person who negotiates an instrument is  defective within the meaning of this act when he obtainel the  mstrument, or any signature thereto, by fraud, duress or force     and fear or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration,  or when he negotiates it in breach of faith or under such cireum-  stances as amount to a fraud.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 56.,Src. 56. To constitute notice of an infirmity in the instrument  or defect in the title of the person negotiating the same the per-  son to whom it is negotiated must have had actual knowledge of  the infirmity or defect or knowledge of such facts that his action  in taking the instrument amounted to bad faith.  
CHAPTER 738.,Sxc. 57.,"Sxc. 57. A holder in due course holds the instrument free frona  any defect of title of prior parties, and free from defenses avail-  able to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment  of the instrument for the full amount thereof against all parties  liable thereon. d  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 58.,Src. 58. In the hands of any holder other than a holder in due  course a negotiable instrument is subject to the same defenses as  if it were non-negotiable. Buta holder who derives his title  through a holder in due course and who is not himself a party to  any fraud or illegality affecting the instrument has all the rights  of such former holder in respect of all parties prior to the latter.  
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 59.,Src. 59. Every holder is deemed prima facie to be a holder in  due course; but when it is shown that the title of any person who  has negotiated the instrument was defective the burden is on the  holder to prove that he or some person under whom he claims  acquired the title as a holder in due course. But the last-men-  tioned rule does not apply in favor of a party who became bound  on the instrument prior. to the acquisition of such defective title.    ARTICLE V.LIABILITIES OF PARTIES.   
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 60.,"Src. 60. The maker of a negotiable instrument by making it  engages that he will pay it according to its tenor, and admits the  existence of the payee and his then capacity to indorse.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 61.,"Src. 61. The drawer by drawing the instrument admits the ex-  istence of the payee and histhen capacity to indorse, and engages  that on due presentment the instrument will be accepted or paid,  or both, according to its tenor, and that if it be dishonored and  the necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken. he will pay  the amount thereof to the holder or to any subsequent indorser.  who may be compelled to pay it. But the drawer may insert in  the instrument an express stipulation negativing or limiting his  own lability to the holder.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 62.,"Src. 62. The acceptor by accepting the instrument engages that  he will pay it according to the tenor of his acceptance; and ad-  nits:   1. That existence of the drawer, the genuineness of his signa-  ture and his capacity and authority to draw the instrument; and   2. The existence of the payee and his then capacity to indorse.    "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 63.,"Sec. 63. A person placing his signature upon an instrument  otherwise than as maker, draweror acceptor is deemed to be an  ndorser, unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his in-  tention to be bound in some other capacity. ,  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 64.,"Src. 64.

TITLE JI.BILLS AND EXCHANGE.  ARTICLE I.FORM AND INTERPRETATION.    ."
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 126.,"SEc. 126. A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writ-  ing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person  giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on  demand or ai a fixed or determinable future time a sum certain  im money to order or to bearer.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 127.,"Src. 127. A bill of itself does not operate as an assignment  ef the funds in the hands of the drawee available for the pay-  ment thereof, and the drawee is not liable on the bill unless and  until he accepts the same.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SkEc. 128.,"SkEc. 128. A bill may be addressed to two or more drawees  jointly whether they are partners or not, but not to two or more  drawees in the alternative or in succession.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 129.,"Sec. 129. An inland bill of exchange is a bill which is or on its  face purports to be both drawn and payable within this state.  Any other bill is a foreign bill. Unless the contrary appears on  the face of the bill the holder may treat it as-an inland bill.   S=c. 130. Where in a bill drawer and drawee are the same per-  son, or where the drawee isa fictitious person or a person not  having capacity to contract, the holder may treat the instrument  at his option, either as a bill of exchange or a promissory note.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 181.,"Src. 181. The drawer ofa bill and any endorser may insert  thereon the name of a person to whom the holder way resort in  ease of need; that is to say, in case the bill is dishonored by non-  acceptance or non-payment. Such person is called the referee in  ease of need. It isin the option of the holder to resort to the  referee in case of need or not as he may see fit.    ARTICLE II.ACCEPTANCE.    Src. 181. The acceptance may be written on any part and it  must be written on one part only. If the drawee accepts more  than one part and such accepted parts are negotiated to differ-  ent holders in due course he is liable on every such part as if it  were a separate bill.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 132.,SEc. 132. The acceptance of a billis the signification by the  drawee of his assent to the order of the drawer. The acceptance  must be in writing and signed by the drawer. It must not ex-  press that the drawee will perform his promise by any other  means than the payment of money.  
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 138.,"Src. 138. The holder of a bill presenting the same for accept-  ance may require that the acceptance be written on the bill, and  if such request is refused may treat the bill as dishonored.   Src. 138. A bill may be accepted before it has been signed by  the drawer or while otherwise incomplete, or when it is overdue,  or after it has been dishonored by a previous refusal to accept,  or by non-payment. But when a bill payable after sight is dis-  honored by non-acceptance and the drawee subsequently accepts  it the holder in the absence of any different agreement is entitled  to have the bill accepted as of the date of the first presentment.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 134.,"Sec. 134. Where an acceptance is written on a paper other than  the bill itself it does not bind the acceptor except in favor of a  person to whom it is shown and who, on the faith thereof, re-  eeives the bill for value.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 135.,"Sec. 135. An unconditional promise in writing to accept a bill  before it is drawn is deemed an actual acceptance in favor of     every persgn who, upon the faith thereof, receives the bill for  value.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sec. 136.,"Sec. 136. The drawec is allowed twenty four hours after pre-  sentment in which to decide whether or not he will accept the  bill, but the acceptance if given dates as of the day of presenta-  tion.  "
CHAPTER 738.,SEc. 137.,"SEc. 137. Where a drawee to whom a bill is delivered for accept-  ance destroys the same or refuses within twenty-four hours after  such delivery, or within such other period as the holder may  allow, to return the bill accepted or non-accepted to the holder,  he will be deemed to have accepted the same.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Sxc. 139.,Sxc. 139. An acceptance is either general or qualified. A gen-  eral acceptance assents without qualification to the order of the  drawer. A qualified acceptance in express terms varies the effect  of the bill as drawn.  
CHAPTER 738.,Src 140.,Src 140. An acceptance to pay at a particular place is a gen-  eral acceptance unless it expressly states that the bill is to be  paid there only and not elsewhere.  
CHAPTER 738.,Skc. 141.,"Skc. 141. An acceptance is qualified which is:   (1) Conditional; that is to say, which makes payment by the  acceptor dependent on the fulfillment of a condition therein  stated. ,   (2) Partial; that is to say, an acceptance to pay part only of  the amount for which the bill is drawn.   (8) Local; that is to say, an acceptance to pay only at a par-  ticular place.   (4) Qualified as to time.   (5) The acceptance of some one or more of the drawees, but  not of all.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 142.,"Src. 142. The holder may refuse to take a qualified acceptance,  and if he does not obtain an unqualified acceptance he may treat  the bill as dishonored by non-acceptance. When a qualified ac-  ceptance is taken the drawer and endorsers are discharged from  liability on the bill unless they have expressly or impliedly au-  thorized the holder to take a qualified acceptance or subsequently  assent thereto. When the drawer or an endorser receives notice  of a qualified acceptance he must within a reasonable time ex-  press his dissent to the holder or he will be deemed to have as-  sented thereto.     ARTICLE III.PRESENTMENT FOR ACCEPTANCE.   "

In no other case is presentment for acceptance necessary in or-  der to render any party io the bill liable.  "
CHAPTER 738.,Src. 144.,Src. 144. Except as herein otherwise provided the holder of a  bill which is required by the next preceding section to be pre-  sented for acceptance must either present it for acceptance or  negotiate it within a reasonable time.
